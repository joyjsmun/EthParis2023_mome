## Summary

Mome is an decentralized media platform that allows users to create content and participate in daily time capsules. By the end of each day, the 12 most popular posts of the day will be selected to be sealed in an on-chain capsule as ERC-6551 NFTs, preserving the content forever. Additionally, the app provides a map feature to visualize the geographical locations of the 12 posts, enabling users to explore the global reach of the platform's content.

## Features

1. **Daily Time Capsules**: Each day, a new time capsule is opened where users can post and upvote content. At the end of the day, the top 12 moments, determined by user votes, are permanently sealed on the blockchain as a single ERC-6551 NFT.

2. **User Authentication**: To access the app's features, users need to verify with worldID, ensuring a secure and personalized experience.

4. **Geolocation Map**: The app provides a geographical map view, allowing users to see the locations where the 12 most popular posts were posted from. This feature adds a unique dimension to the content's discovery and engagement.

5. **Minting Own Posts**: Users have the ability to mint their own posts into NFTs. This feature enables content creators to uniquely tokenize their contributions and have full ownership of their moments.

6. **Token-Gated Chatroom**: Users who actively participate in posting and voting within a daily time capsule gain access to the day's token-gated chatroom. This creates an exclusive and engaged community centered around the day's content.

### How it works

1. **Login**: Verify with WorldID, sign in with Particle network.

2. **Create and Vote**: Once the daily time capsule opens, post your content and engage with other posts by upvoting. The 12 most popular moments will be chosen for the day's NFT.

3. **Geolocation Map**: Explore the world map to see where the selected 12 posts originated, offering an exciting perspective on the global impact of the content.

4. **Mint Your Posts**: If you wish to tokenized your own posts, go to the "Minting" section and follow the guided steps to create your unique NFT.

5. **Token-Gated Chatroom**: Users who actively participate in the time capsule throughout the day will automatically receive access to the day's token-gated chatroom.
